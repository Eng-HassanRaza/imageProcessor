Image Resizer Feature Request 3.9.209

v.2. recap

traverses a directory structure ignoring nodes with keywords, such as 'process'

copy image, resize image copy, moves image copy to a destination directory

log entry

V.3 function

during V.2 traverse but before copy/resize/move two things must happen.

1 -The DrawingCode must be validated

Code on the image will also be the image file name. If the filename/code image does NOT conform, enter appropriate log and move to the next file. Do NOT copy, move, resize. If image name/drawing code is valid:

2 - Full size image is moved

Using image recognition merge the file to the Production Image Collection. THIS IS A NEW DIRECTORY STUCTURE. This is NOT the same destination for the resize and copy. (that comes next. There are two possibilities for this new ‘Full Size Image is Moved’ operation:

· Image recognition finds a match at the determined confidence level

o Move the old version to an archive, log the archive action in the new ‘archive log’

o Move the new full-size image and replace the old version. Log the replacement in a new ‘merge log’. Action Type ‘Replace’

· Image recognition does NOT find a match

o Using the image name/dawing code

§ Create the appropriate directory

· Requires lookup txt file

§ Move the new full-size image to the newly created directory and log to the new ‘merge log’. Action Type ‘New’
